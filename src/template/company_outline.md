Recommended outline:

# Company Fundamentals (Foundation)
Purpose: build a 360° view of the company and answer “what type of business is this?”  
- Corporate history: timeline of milestones, strategic pivots, and growth phases.  
- Leadership: background of founders and key executives; highlight governance quality and strategic capability.

Financing & ownership:
- Financing history: show key rounds to illustrate investor confidence over time.  
- Shareholding structure: ownership mix, control, concentration, and shareholder-base trends.  
- (Optional) Share-price review: overlay price movements with internal/external catalysts to decode drivers.

# External Context & Business Model
Purpose: position the company within its macro/industry setting and explain how it makes money.  
- Industry analysis: quantify TAM, historical CAGR, and 3-year outlook; discuss saturation risks.  
- Business deep dive: cover product/service portfolio, monetization model, differentiation, moat, and competitive landscape.

# Financial Deep Dive
Use a structured flow for each subsection: **data → trend → drivers → forward view**.  
- Revenue analysis: scale, mix, cohort dynamics.  
- Net profit: sustainability of earnings, key levers (cost, R&D, one-offs).  
- Gross margin: pricing power and structural profitability.  
- Operating expenses: efficiency of SG&A/R&D.  
- Cash flow: operating vs. investing vs. financing patterns to infer life cycle.

# Outlook & Valuation Bridge
Purpose: quantify future performance and determine intrinsic value.  
- Forecasts: project core metrics (revenue, margin, expense ratios) using evidence built earlier.  
- Use standard notation such as 2024H1 / 1H24.

# Valuation & Investment Call
- Choose valuation frameworks tailored to the business (PS, PE, PB, DCF, etc.).  
- Run comparables vs. peers with similar business models/scale.  
- Synthesize fair-value range and issue a clear call (Buy/Hold/Sell) tied to upside/downside.

# Key Risks
Provide targeted, data-backed risk disclosures covering:  
- Macro/market shocks (policy, cycle).  
- Industry/competitive risks (tech disruption, regulation).  
- Company-specific issues (execution, financial, governance, supply chain). Always include “Forecast shortfall risk.”  
- Methodology risks (valuation assumptions).  
Each risk should tie directly to arguments made earlier—avoid generic boilerplate.
